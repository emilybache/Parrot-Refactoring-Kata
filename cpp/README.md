Parrot in C++
==============

There are three test projects here, using the popular test frameworks [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2, [Doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) and [GoogleTest](http://google.github.io/googletest/) respectively. Choose the one you prefer. You could use [Approvals](https://approvaltestscpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) with any of them.

Refer to [top level README](../README.md) for exercise instructions.
